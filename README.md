Welcome to the IBM STEM4Girls Teen Tech Clubs - Canada, Markham Chapter!

## Pre-requisites
A good What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get(WYSIWYG) Editor with HTML highlighting and other cool features can make coding so much easier! We are have few recommendation:
1. [The Atom Editor](https://atom.io) is an open source editor freely available on Windows and Mac

1. [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com) is another good choice.
1. An [online web editor](https://html-online/editor/) is also available if you don't want to install anything. Just remember to save your file locally on your laptop when you finish.
