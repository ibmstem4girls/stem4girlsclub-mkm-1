# Club Website Coding Activity - Getting Started

Welcome to the IBM STEM4Girls Teen Tech Clubs - Canada, Markham Chapter!

## Pre-requisites
A good WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) Editor with HTML highlighting and other cool features can make coding so much easier! We are have few recommendation:
1. The Atom Editor: It's an open source editor freely available on Windows and Mac download it from here: https://atom.io/ and follow the instructions to install it your lab top.
2. Sublime is another good choice, available here: http://www.sublimetext.com/
3. If you don't want to install either of them locally, there is web based editor available at https://html-online.com/editor/. However, if you use this editor, you'd need to remember to save your work to a local file if you want to keep it.
